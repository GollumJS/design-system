Icons to be extended by SASS placeholder, leading to a dataUrl encode in the dist CSS file

- **Note 1:** Icons that are not extended will not be printed to CSS dist file
- **Note 2:** Monochrome icons have to be duplicated to each color use case.
- **Note 3:** Files larger than `params.limit.svg` weight param (`./atomic-framework.params.js` file) will be outputed as an external file

Use this functionality if you need multicolor icons, or if you need to provide several icons to the Design System that will might not be used.
